		<p>Though a little dated, this book is still an excellent pocket resource for just about everything sail related, with one page guides on a huge variety of sailing topics.</p>
		<p>The book also features some good nautical references including the meanings of channel markers, lights, flags, etc, that aren't found in the other books.</p>
